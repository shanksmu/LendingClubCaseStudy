## General Information

The Lenders Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
-  If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
-  If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Objective of this project is to use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
Understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

Loan Data Set is provided which contains the raw data of borrowers who had gotten loans.
Data Dictionary is also to provide to describle the columns names in the above data set.
